**`camply`**, the campsite finder ⛺️, is a tool to help you book a campsite online. Finding
reservations at sold out campgrounds can be tough. That's where camply comes in. It searches
thousands of campgrounds across the ~~USA~~ world via the APIs of booking services like
[recreation.gov](https://recreation.gov). It continuously checks for cancellations and
availabilities to pop up - once a campsite becomes available, camply sends you a notification
to book your spot!

### cli

- This directory contains the legacy command-line interface (CLI) for the project.
  There will be no further development on this CLI and it can be ignored for new
  features.

### frontend

- The frontend of the application is a React application built with TypeScript.
- It uses Vite as the build tool and includes all necessary configurations for
  development and production builds.
- It leverages modern React features and libraries for state management,
  routing, and UI components.
- It uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
- The frontend should be able to be published as a static site that can be served
  by any web server.

### backend

- The backend of the application is built with Python.
- The backend is a `uv` workspace containing multiple packages:
  - `backend/`: The FastAPI application that serves the API endpoints.
  - `db/`: Contains database models and migrations.
  - `providers/`: Contains third-party API providers and integrations.
  - `worker/`: Celery-powered background task worker for campsite polling, availability diffing, and Pushover notification delivery.
